## Engineer notes

I've worked in the exercise ~10 hours, slightly over time but I wanted to get it closer to the final product I'd like to build if I had the time.

Guided tour steps can be set within `index.tsx` file.

Thinks I'd do better if I had the time:

- Guided tour state is not persisted so it doesn't show only once. I don't want to spend more time on the exercise and this shouldn't be a big deal should I have prior experience with Electron.
- Input figure fields do not clear their value when on focus and needs some extra user interaction to type the correct figure.
- Quick stake buttons not having a fancy `hover` state. Not considered a priority but a nice to have at this point.
- Quick stake buttons do not stay selected when clicked.
- Stake button CTA not having a background transition on `hover`.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Thank you.
